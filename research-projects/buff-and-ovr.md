### Player overall rating

The ratings shown of the player card is definited as Player overall rating. Although some players, such as Guerrero of Dourmund, have a higher rating than player overall rating in non-registered positions, the impact is only related with their player overall rating. There is a small increase in the overall rating when a player is put in a team with high team spirit, but the buff and debuff of the attributes still follows the rating without the increase.

### Attribute categories
There are three main categories of the player attributes: Awareness (足球意识), Technique (足球能力/技术), and Athleticsim (运动能力/体育).
- Awareness: Attributes describing the awareness in the player's mind.
- Technique: Attributes related to the ball.
- Athleticsim: Attibutes related to the player's physical abilities rather than ball abilities.

## Conclusion
The general trend is that, as the overall rating of the player goes higher, the buff he get when in good form gets smaller, the debuff he get when in bad form gets greater. In other words, as the overall rating goes lower, the buff gets greater and debuff gets smaller. This allows **underrated players** to have a place in the squad of non-paying or few-paying players.
**Underrated players**: Players who have a higher (usually larger or equal to 4) rating in non-registered postion than registered postion.
Since compared to normal players, they have a high buff when in good form and a lower debuff when in bad form.

### Underrated Player List
Four points will be left for the team playstyle development of each player. There is more than one development path to realize.
