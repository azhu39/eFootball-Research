### Player overall rating

The ratings shown of the player card is definited as Player overall rating. Although some players, such as Guerrero of Dourmund, have a higher rating than player overall rating in non-registered positions, the impact is only related with their player overall rating. There is a small increase in the overall rating when a player is put in a team with high team spirit, but the buff and debuff of the attributes still follows the rating without the increase.

### Attribute categories
There are three main categories of the player attributes: Awareness (足球意识), Technique (足球能力/技术), and Athleticsim (运动能力/体育).
- Awareness: Attributes describing the awareness in the player's mind.
- Technique: Attributes related to the ball.
- Athleticsim: Attibutes related to the player's physical abilities rather than ball abilities.
